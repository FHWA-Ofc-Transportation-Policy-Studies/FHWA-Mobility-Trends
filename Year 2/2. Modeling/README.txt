The modeling folder is strucutred into four primary folders that are part of the Mobility Trends Indicator Report. 

- Feature Development- Experimental features as we worked to create the champion models and exploratory data analysis (not nessary to create champion models)
- Modeling - The LASSO models and other iterations to build the champion models and turn them to RDS files
- Sensitivity Analysis - The use of the Champions models to understand how a 1% change in the data effects the performance metric
- Data - Where data files sit to run code in modeling folder
- EDA - Exploratory Data analysis

The primary files to run in this folder are 
1. Modeling/Modeling Template - which can be used to create rds files related to the performance metric, as well as get metrics associated with the model.
2. Sensitivity Analysis - Creates the sensitivity analysis results related to the performance metric.
