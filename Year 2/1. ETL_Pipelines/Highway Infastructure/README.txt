County lane miles are pulled from FHWA provided files from 2000-2009, 2010-2019, and 2020.

From these files we pull Interstate, Principal Arterial, and Highway data. 

Some data from 2009 and 2010 are imputed using straight line imputation.

This data is mostly put together by hand, with some cleaning done through ipynb files.
