Transit data requires unique preprocessing due to UPT (and capital funding for the TMS champion model) being collected on an MSA level.

Subsequently, the team distributes UPT/Cap funding based on different county level data. For our main Transit measure, we distribute 
Transit users by the number of commuters who use transit in a given county (IE, if there are 3 counties in an MSA that has 1M UPT, and county 1 has 10% of the transit users, we say county 1 has 100K UPT).

For TMS champion model, we distribute using the number of households with zero vehicles.
