GHG is put together from the 2008 through 2020 (every 3 year) files. Our GHG measure combines Methane and C02 emissions.

Note that, due to the size of the raw data from NEI, only the transformed data is available for each of the year folders. 

If you would like to access the raw NEI data, you can download it at:
