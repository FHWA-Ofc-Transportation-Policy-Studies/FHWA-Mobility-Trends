Year 1 is broken up into ETL (task 3), Modeling (task 4), and Policy Analysis (task 6) codebases. Each of these codebases has it's own README with instructions and details about how to run the code. 

Feel free to reach out to Zach Pate (zapate@deloitte.com) with any questions or concerns with the code.
